    "这样意味着 Python 是一行一行执行的，因此它具有 Fortran，C 或者 Java 这些编译型语言无法做的到“交互”的特性。\n",
    "这一节会介绍4种运行 Python 代码的主要方法：使用*PyPython interpreter* 或 *IPython interpreter*，运行*Self-contained Scripts*，或者使用*Jupyter notebook*。"

    "An alternative interpreter called *IPython* (for Interactive Python) is bundled with the Anaconda distribution, and includes a host of convenient enhancements to the basic Python interpreter.\n",
    "It can be started by typing ``ipython`` at the command prompt:\n",

    "The main aesthetic difference between the Python interpreter and the enhanced IPython interpreter lies in the command prompt: Python uses ``>>>`` by default, while IPython uses numbered commands (e.g. ``In [1]:``).\n",
    "Regardless, we can execute code line by line just as we did before:\n",

    "\n",
    "Running Python snippets line by line is useful in some cases, but for more complicated programs it is more convenient to save code to file, and execute it all at once.\n",
    "By convention, Python scripts are saved in files with a *.py* extension.\n",
    "For example, let's create a script called *test.py* which contains the following:\n",

    "\n",
    "A useful hybrid of the interactive terminal and the self-contained script is the *Jupyter notebook*, a document format that allows executable code, formatted text, graphics, and even interactive features to be combined into a single document.\n",
    "Though the notebook began as a Python-only format, it has since been made compatible with a large number of programming languages, and is now an essential part of the [*Jupyter Project*](https://jupyter.org/).\n",
    "The notebook is useful both as a development environment, and as a means of sharing work via rich computational and data-driven narratives that mix together code, figures, data, and text."
